PYTHON PROGRAMMING TASK LIST

1. MASTERMIND GAME

Two players play the game against each other; let’s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.

2. ROCK PAPER SCISSOR GAME

Winning Rules as follows:

Rock vs paper-> paper wins

Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins

paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.

3. CREATING PAYMENT RECEIPT

Creating payment receipts is a pretty common task, be it an e-commerce website or any local store for that matter.

Here, you have to create our own transaction receipts just by using python. We would be using reportlab to generate the PDFs. Generally, it comes as a built-in package but sometimes it might not be present too. If it’s not present, then simply type the following in your terminal
